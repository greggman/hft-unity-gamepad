*   Support multi-game and installation mode through node

    *   Check for localhost?

        In multi-game mode --hft-url=ws://ipaddress:18679 tells
        it to use that address for hft

        Is a no argument version better or just use --hft-url=ws://localhost:18679
        for installation mode
