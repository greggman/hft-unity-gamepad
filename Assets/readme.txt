HappyFunTimes Unity Plugin and Example Scene
============================================

HappyFunTimes lets you use your phone as a controller
to control a game. This lets you make unique controllers
or make locally multiplayer games that support tens or 
hundreds of people.

Docs and Videos are available from the menus at Window->HappyFunTimes->Docs
